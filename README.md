# 📺 Project II: A Classic YouTube Clone (HTML & CSS Only)

Hey there! 🙋‍♂️
Welcome to my second web design project — a nostalgic throwback to the **classic YouTube layout**, built entirely with **HTML5** and **CSS**. No JavaScript, no frameworks — just clean, hand-coded front-end magic. ✨

---

## 🚀 Why This Project?

I wanted to challenge myself by recreating a familiar and functional UI — and the old-school YouTube design was perfect for it! This gave me a chance to dive deeper into responsive layouts and interface replication, pixel by pixel.

---

## 💡 What I Learned

* **HTML Structuring**: Building grids of videos, navbars, sidebars, and comments.
* **CSS Layouts**: Flexbox, Grid, spacing, and alignment to match the original look.
* **Responsive Design**: Making it work well across screen sizes.
* **Attention to Detail**: Nailing those tiny design elements that make a UI feel real.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Used

* HTML5
* CSS3 (Flexbox + Grid)

---

## 🔮 What's Next?

This project was a huge step in solidifying my front-end foundation. Next up:

* Adding interactivity with **JavaScript**
* Exploring **modern UI frameworks** (React, Tailwind, etc.)
* Building dynamic apps and components
